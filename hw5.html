		<pre>1. IaaS might be better than PaaS in situations when software maintenence is not an issue, but rather hardware space is an issue. For example,
IaaS can be more useful that PaaS when you do not have much capital for hardware. In this case, you can use IaaS to purchase storage space and 
maintain the software components on your own.

2. There are a few risks of moving to cloud computing: there is less privacy because you are not maintaining things completely yourself. Also, some cloud 
computing security systems are easy to break into, making your apps and code not completely secure. Another big risk is if the providers' server goes down 
or you get locked out of your account. If these things happen then you do not have access to your own code even though the problem is not on your end.</pre>
